## üì¢ &nbsp; Milestone Check-Ins

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

‚öôÔ∏è Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
üåµ Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
üèÜ Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
üîÆ Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Milestone 1

For this milestone you will have created a wireframe prototype in Figma.  Post your link here, so you have easy access to it.

### Milestone 2

My next stand up will go here...

### Milestone 3

Stay tuned, this stand up is coming soon. Remember to include links to the API and Libraries used.  Also discuss your persistent data
Check documentation on FSO for everything that is required!

### Milestone 4

My final stand up...

# Project Overview

### Your project will use the MERN Tech Stack and must include the following:

-   A Git Repo, with a master, dev, and milestone branches
-   Readme File that explains your project and tracks your milestones
-   A React Front End
-   React Routing with  _at least_  4 different views/pages
    -   Dashboard/Main
    -   User/Settings
    -   Search
    -   Detail Page
-   Node/Express Backend
-   A Mongo DB Element OR Local Storage for persistent data
-   Connect to at least 1 free API
-   The project must use at least 2 different libraries, not including React itself
    -   One of these libraries you will create a tutorial for in Exercise 01
-   It should look visually appealing and must be easy for the end-user to use and understand. You may use Tailwind or any other front-end library/framework.

**Milestone #1 (Due: Monday of Week 2)**

-   Decide on your topic and theme for your project.
    -   Check out the Free API sites for some ideas of an API that you can utilize
        -   [Apipheny](https://apipheny.io/free-api/)  
            
        -   [Mixed Analytics](https://mixedanalytics.com/blog/list-actually-free-open-no-auth-needed-apis/)  
            
        -   [I Am Sajan](https://iamsajan.com/free-api-without-an-api-key/)  
            
-   Functional Spec that explains the scope of the work and the deadlines that must be met.  
    
-   Create a Wireframe Prototype in Figma that will help non-tech people understand your idea.
    -   Keep in mind that a lot of your bosses will need only high-level concepts and will not be concerned with the actual code. The code is your job.

**Milestone #2 **(Due: Monday of Week 3)****

-   Create your Git Repo using the provided link, which will clone over a blank repo.
-   Start to code your project.
    -   I will not give you a step-by-step guide for this.
    -   At this point, you must use your skills and build it out yourself.
-   Along the way, if you get stuck, you may reach out to the lab assistants, but remember this is YOUR portfolio project, and troubleshooting your own code is a part of this process.
-   By Milestone #2, I am going to be checking that you have a React app that can compile without error and that you have your navigation up and running.

**Milestone #3 **(Due: Monday of Week 4)****

-   By this point, you should have a functional prototype of your project. It might not look pretty yet, but that is what the final week is for.
-   Your Git Repo should have a number of significant commits pushed to it.

**Milestone #4 **(Due: Sunday of Week 4)****

-   Your completed project will be due.
-   You must create a (3 to 10) minute long video that goes through your project, what you did this month, and the technologies that you used to get it working.
    -   Remember it is your job to sell your work and really show it off.
